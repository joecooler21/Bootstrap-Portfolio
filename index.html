        <p>Now this is a story all about how
            My life got flipped-turned upside down
            And I'd like to take a minute
            Just sit right there
            I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air</p>
            
            <p>In west Philadelphia born and raised
            On the playground was where I spent most of my days
            Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
            And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school
            When a couple of guys who were up to no good
            Started making trouble in my neighborhood
            I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
            She said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air"</p>
            
            <p>I whistled for a cab and when it came near
            The license plate said "Fresh" and it had dice in the mirror
            If anything I could say that this cab was rare
            But I thought, "Nah, forget it"
            â€“ "Yo, home to Bel-Air"</p>
            
            <p>I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8
            And I yelled to the cabbie, "Yo home smell ya later"
            I looked at my kingdom
            I was finally there
            To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel-Air</p>
